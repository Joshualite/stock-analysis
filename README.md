# Stock-analysis


## Overview of Project

For this project, I work on a script or code to analyze which are the best shares of the stock market in which one should invest, the automation of the analysis was created through a code programmed in VBA, in which some modifications were made so that it will perform the task more quickly and efficiently.

## Results

To execute and check the times of each of the codes, buttons were created for the old code and the new code with the following names:

- Select a Year for Analysis(original code)
- Analysis Refactored (new code)


These were the runtimes with the original code:
- 2017 = 0.6171875
- 2018 = 0.625

And these were the results when modifying the code:
- 2017 = 0.085938
- 2018 = 0.093750

As we can see through the execution times between both codes, it was an improvement to modify the original code so that it would work faster. From what we can deduce that if we occupy the same code in a larger database, the improvement would be even more noticeable.

## Summary

When wanting to improve or recode some code, you really have to evaluate if an improvement is being made, since we are working on a code that already works and that already gives results, we could have the advantage that we add something that improves its functionality either in time or because it provides us with new information, but we should also think that if it is really necessary to make that modification, if it only improves in a very insignificant way, we would have to evaluate if it is really worth investing the time to make that modification, In this work I realized that you have to review all the previous code so that the modifications we make are consistent with what we had done before and can work properly, for that reason we have to think about what we want to improve and if it is worth it. the change.
